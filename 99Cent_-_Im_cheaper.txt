You be cheap! I'm be cheaper! More, or less....

Why you selling ???
Do you need the money ???
Is it fir the collective ???
Do you fund a.war wallet with it ???
Or pay OSS Devs to improve the tools ???

So why you selling?
In public ?!
In the spotlights!
Visible for all!

For the eyes of the people payed to fight against us, too!
The will document it...
Making presentations with it...
Sell there products with it...

...and then we have to fight against them, again.
A multi frontline war on many levels we fight...
So does aome more frontline s change anything?

IDK! But I think so!
So why you selling ???

(Just some slim notes...)
