We don't want to create one more botnet...
And it seems there are a lot organization probs around...
Plan is to bring all together/merge...

Having a lot of designs maybe aren't the worst ATM... Lets let it as it is!
Ultimate plan: Merge all! (In maybe the next 2 years ???)
Maybe we can start to unify them...
All the same plugins/modules API so all modules are liked by any father ???

We will see...
