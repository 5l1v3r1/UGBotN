Thought a bit about Pluginy vs. Modules and think now that "Modules" would be the better term!

The thing is, that it IMHO would lete4 be a good idea to the whole crowed into pices and set them DLL together, again.

Then we can use body parts where we want & need! ^^ Yes, we are the right hand of <who ever> and real dev(ill)s! *rofl*

The we can ship our parts as modules - plug-ins wouldn't fit!

To be exact:
- Body Part Modules
- Bionic Modules ,..and...
- E.g. Shuttle Modules

...but to our Enterprise Shuttles later more... ^^
