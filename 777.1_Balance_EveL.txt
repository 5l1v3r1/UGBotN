My Salsa:

We thought about to bring a new skill set to our RPG Player: WWII Member of the Resistance!

The Skill would be defined not to be able to be Dictator and declare The Ultimate War, instead have with very less recources to harm the enemy as much as possible!

Riots during this time had high impact on the normal operations of the enemy by trying to bind recources with minimal work just so much, that normal operation was no more possible.
Often the administration got very stressed, as no real army was visible and fightable.

The Resistance should get the skill to e.g. build a War Wallet, like M$ had in past.
