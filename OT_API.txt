Maybe a bit OT (Off Topic), but here some thoughts I made for adding and triggering Modules by a TG (Telegram) Up-/Download Bot and as consequence to the idea of a general "Universal Up-/Download Bot/Server"...
(Will move this later to the LVC Repos...)

I'm no programmer of a modern, higher programming language, and so it's maybe total stupid... but I thought: KISS!

KISS = Keep It Simple Stupid
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle

If I want to give as many people as possible the chance to write a module, it would be best to even make a module possible that is written with a script.

So the consequence is, that the best API would be, to trigger the modules (all, or at least the scripts) just via a defined script. E.g. phenix.sh (risn at the end from the asses of all former servers).
A trigger of phenix.sh could be a scheduler module. (If needed ones and now, so the task for scheduler would be "single" and "immidiatly".)
And finally the module gives anything back, and the scheduler can hopefully handle it. (Simple standard error codes...)

If status of module is needed, module can maybe triggered again and give anyhow the status back.)

Maybe a bit simple thought and completely OT, but maybe also a small inspiration to design something useful.


Just my thoughts...
